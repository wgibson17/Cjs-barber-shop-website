# Cjs 

Messing around trying to make a decent website for my barber. he works alone so most likely not going to put an appointment scheduling application 
but will resereach for the future.

Completed - 
1. screen size responsiveness
2. Links to all socials
3. took out javascript for nav menu on media query and simplifed it into css. javascript would not work with an onload event to hide the javascript. the menu would appear onload ruining the user expierence. I would of liked to keep it javascript but there was NO known fix for this issue.

to do -
1. Arrow to jump back to top of the page?
2. Cancel button for menu hamburger display?
3. Clean up dead css code
4. Add a form for party/wedding inquires
