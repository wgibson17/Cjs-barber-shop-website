# Cjs 

Messing around trying to make a decent website for my barber. he works alone so most likely not going to put an appointment scheduling application 
but will resereach for the future.

To do list:
Positioning of items,
Larger icons,
mobile compatability,
Instagram/Facebook feed <-- important

social links to be added along with a valid email and phone number if he wants to publish the domain
